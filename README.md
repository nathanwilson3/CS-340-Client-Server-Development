## Grazioso Salvare Dashboard

This repository contains the final dashboard code and README file from Project Two of the CS 340 course. The project includes a fully functional MongoDB dashboard that allows users to interact with and visualize data about rescue animals.

### Reflection

#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves several best practices:

- **Modular Code**: By breaking down the code into smaller, reusable modules, such as the CRUD Python module, it becomes easier to manage and update. Each module handles a specific functionality, making the codebase more organized.
- **Clear Naming Conventions**: Using descriptive variable and function names helps in understanding the purpose of each part of the code. This practice enhances readability and makes it easier for others to follow the code.
- **Documentation**: Including comments and documentation within the code provides context and explanations, which are helpful for future maintenance and for new developers working on the project.
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests ensures that the code works as expected and helps in identifying issues early. It also makes it safer to make changes and refactor the code.

For the CRUD Python module from Project One, these practices were particularly beneficial. The module was easy to integrate with the dashboard widgets in Project Two, demonstrating its reusability and adaptability. In the future, this CRUD module could be used in other projects that require database interactions, saving time and effort in development.

#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist involves several steps:

1. **Understanding Requirements**: The first step is to thoroughly understand the requirements of the project. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, this involved understanding the data needs and the desired functionalities of the dashboard.
2. **Planning and Design**: Planning the structure of the database and the dashboard components is crucial. Designing the schema for the MongoDB database and planning the interactive elements of the dashboard were key steps in this project.
3. **Implementation**: Breaking down the implementation into smaller tasks and writing the code in an iterative manner helps in managing the complexity. For this project, implementing the CRUD operations and then building the dashboard components were done step-by-step.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Testing the individual components and validating them against the requirements ensures that the project meets the expected standards. Each part of the dashboard and the CRUD module was tested thoroughly.
5. **Iteration and Improvement**: Based on feedback and testing results, iterating and improving the solution is an ongoing process.

This approach to problem-solving helps in creating robust and efficient solutions. In future projects, using similar techniques and strategies will be beneficial in meeting client requirements effectively.

#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design, develop, and maintain software solutions that solve real-world problems. They play a crucial role in various industries by creating systems that improve efficiency, enable data analysis, and facilitate communication. For companies like Grazioso Salvare, computer scientists develop applications that help in managing data about rescue animals, enabling better decision-making and resource management. This type of work directly contributes to the organization's mission, making their operations more effective and impactful.

By developing the dashboard for Grazioso Salvare, my work helped the company to better visualize and manage their data, ultimately aiding in their efforts to identify and train rescue animals. This demonstrates the value of computer science in creating tools that support and enhance the work of various organizations.
